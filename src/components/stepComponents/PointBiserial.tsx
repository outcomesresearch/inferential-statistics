        is a statistical measure used to assess the strength and direction of
        the relationship between a continuous variable and a dichotomous
        variable. Point Bi-serial correlation provides a measure of strength of
        the association between the two variables, indicating how strongly the
        continuous variable is related to the likelihood or probability of
        belonging to a particular category of the dichotomous variable. Point
        Bi-serial correlation test is used to test the null hypothesis that the
        Point Bi-serial correlation is equal to zero.
