      The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is a non-parametric test used to compare
      paired or matched samples of ordinal or continuous variables. It is the
      non-parametric alternative to paired-samples t-test. It is based on
      assigning numerical ranks to observations instead of using their original
      values. This rank-based comparison allows for the examination of variables
      based on their relative positions rather than specific numerical values.
