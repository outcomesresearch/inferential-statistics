      Also known as the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, the Mann-Whitney U Test is a
      non-parametric alternative to the independent samples t-test. It is used
      to compare the distributions of ordinal or continuous variables between
      two independent groups. This test utilizes ranks, where numerical ranks
      are assigned to observations instead of using their original values. By
      considering the ranks, comparisons can be made based on relative positions
      rather than specific numerical values. This approach is suitable for
      non-parametric tests that do not make assumptions about a specific data
      distribution.
