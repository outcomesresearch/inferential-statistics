      The Kruskal-Wallis test is a non-parametric alternative to a one-way
      Analysis of Variance test (ANOVA) when parametric assumptions are not met.
      It can also be seen as an extension of Mann-Whitney U test. It is used to
      compare the distributions of ordinal or continuous variables among three
      or more independent groups. This test involves assigning numerical ranks
      to observations instead of using their original values and the test is
      often presented as comparison of group medians.
