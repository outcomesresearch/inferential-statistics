        is a non-parametric alternative to Pearsonâ€™s correlation that measures
        the correlation between the ranks of two variables. It does not assume a
        linear relationship like Pearson correlation, but measures if a
        monotonic function can be used to present the relationship between 2
        ordinal or continuous level variables.
