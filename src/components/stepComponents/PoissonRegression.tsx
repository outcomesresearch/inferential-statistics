        Poisson Regression is used to analyze count data, and is specifically
        designed for situations where the outcome variable represents the number
        of occurrences or events, such as the number of accidents, customer
        visits, or infections.

        The main purpose of Poisson Regression is to model the relationship
        between multiple predictor variables and the rate or count of the
        outcome. It allows for the estimation of the effects of independent
        variables on the outcome variable, considering potential confounding
        variables. It is recommended to seek assistance from a statistician who
        can provide expertise in implementing and understanding the results of
        this analysis.
