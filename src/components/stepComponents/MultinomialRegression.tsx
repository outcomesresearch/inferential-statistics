        Multinomial Regression is used to analyze a dependent variable with more
        than two categories, and estimates the relationship between the
        independent variables and the multiple categories of the dependent
        variable. It allows for the prediction and understanding of the factors
        influencing each category separately.

        assistance from a statistician.
