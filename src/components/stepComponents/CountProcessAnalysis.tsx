        Count Process Analysis is used to analyze time-to-event outcomes, where
        events are counted over a given period. This analysis technique is
        particularly useful when studying events that occur repeatedly or in a
        recurring manner over time. It allows for the examination of multiple
        independent variables to assess their influence on the timing and
        occurrence of the event of interest.

        The primary objective of Count Process Analysis is to understand how
        various factors contribute to the frequency or rate of events taking
        place. This method considers multiple independent variables and
        determines their association with the occurrence and timing of the
        event. Given the complexity of Count Process Analysis, it is advisable
        to seek assistance from a qualified statistician.
