      Pearson correlation coefficient measures the strength of linear
      relationship between two continuous variables under the assumption that
      the relationship follows a linear pattern. Pearson correlation test is
      used to determine how likely it is that the Pearson Correlation
      Coefficient is different from zero. The test requires meeting parametric
      assumptions.
